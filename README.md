# MBIP_The_Backbenchers
 The MBIP project is a user-centric web application designed to empower users with detailed insights into their utility consumption and environmental activities. Users start by registering with their email, username, password, and phone number, after which they can log in to access various analytical tools. The main features of the application include modules for analyzing water consumption, electricity usage, and recycling activities.  Upon logging in, users can choose to analyze their water consumption by providing details such as location, sector code, submission date, and time range. Similarly, electricity consumption analysis is available by inputting relevant data, allowing users to gain a clear understanding of their energy usage. For recycling activities, users can record information about their recycling practices, including the amount recycled and methods used, and even submit evidence to support their practices.  This project is particularly valuable for residents and authorities in the Iskandar Puteri area, as it offers a structured way to monitor and improve resource management and sustainability efforts. The MBIP project, thus, serves as a crucial tool in promoting efficient utility management and fostering environmentally responsible behaviors within the community.
